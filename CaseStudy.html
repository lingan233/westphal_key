    <h1>Westphal Key Case Study</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to create an interactive touchscreen interface
      that would assist prospective and undecided Westphal students in selecting
      a program of study. Our team of 5 was given about 20 weeks to research,
      design, prototype, and develop this experience, with the aim of addressing
      the issue of the Westphal website's lack of an engaging and user-friendly
      approach to help students explore majors and find the best fit for them.
      By creating an engaging and visually appealing interface, our solution
      aimed to provide students with an approachable tool that would help them
      make informed decisions about their academic future.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Our users are prospective and undecided Westphal students who need a tool
      to help them decide what to study at Westphal college, because the current
      website doesn’t cater to uncertain students and is not engaging.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal was to create an interactive touchscreen interface that would
      assist students in selecting a program of study. Since it would mainly
      live on a touchscreen in the lobby, we wanted this experience to be
      bite-sized so that the user will only need to spend a short amount of time
      in front of the display. By doing so, we wanted this interface to serve as
      a vehicle for students to begin research, something that would spark their
      interests in the majors offered at Westphal.
    </p>

    <h2>The Process, Challenges, and Insight</h2>
    <h3>Research & Persona</h3>
    <p>
      To begin the project, we aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of
      our potential users. Our process started with an in-depth exploration of
      our target audience. We conducted multiple user interviews and then
      synthesized the data using the affinity mapping technique. By doing so, we
      were able to identify the core problems, pain points, and goals that
      students and their families face when exploring majors at Westphal.

    <p>
      We then reviewed our findings alongside some of our initial assumptions.
      Using this information, we developed a User Persona to better understand
      the needs and preferences of our target audience.

    <h3>User Flow</h3>
    <p>
      Having gained a comprehensive understanding of our users, we began the
      deation process by brainstorming a range of possible solutions. During our
      initial designing phase, we wanted to build upon the current website,
      bringing some interactivity and reorganizing the content to make them
      consistent across majors so the student can have an easier time comparing
      them. After some usability testing, we quickly found out that this
      information, as informatics as they are, failed to help our users narrow
      down their selection.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>
        "The last time I was on the website, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of
        information, and the benefits of each major were not adequately
        emphasized or differentiated."</i
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In order to make the project more engaging, we added a questionnaire that
      targets the user’s interests, personality, and work preferences. By doing
      so, we can compare the user selections and the tags associated with each
      major to help them narrow down their selection. After this, we continued
      to refine our user flow by making it more streamlined and easier to
      navigate.

    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
      We began by sketching out our ideas for the low-fidelity prototype. We
      wanted to incorporate components that highlighted the major’s very
      specific details, such as unique aspects of the different curriculums. Our
      flow followed the users sharing details about themselves through a 3
      question, multiple choice “personality quiz”.
